Lang-Toggler

Overview

Lang-Toggler is a macOS utility that allows users to seamlessly toggle between Hebrew and English keyboard input. It automatically detects the language of the selected text, converts it, and pastes the translated text back into the active field. The script also resizes and centers the terminal window for an optimized user experience.

Features
	â€¢	Automatic Language Detection: Identifies if the copied text is in Hebrew or English.
	â€¢	Smart Text Conversion: Converts text based on keyboard mappings for accurate toggling.
	â€¢	Clipboard Integration: Copies, processes, and pastes text automatically.
	â€¢	Terminal Resizing: Adjusts and centers the terminal window dynamically.
	â€¢	Keystroke Logging: Tracks key inputs and displays them in a minimal UI.
	â€¢	Hotkey Activation: Press Ctrl + S to trigger the language toggle.
	â€¢	macOS Terminal/iTerm2 Support: Works seamlessly with macOS terminal applications.
